# HTML

We'll be using [FreeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org) for Modules 1-3 but feel free to use any resource to learn, as long as you are able to do the Mini Project with minimal online help.

### Learning Expectations:
*Basic HTML document structure
*Meta tags
*Linking
*Lists
*Images
*Text Elements
*Forms


### Mini Project:
Create a multipage site purely from HTML.
Should include:
*Sitemap
*All types of text elements
*At least one image
*A form
*Proper Structure/Good Readability

Feel free to be as creative as you want. Bonus points for meme value.
FYI we will create a personal website in Module 3, so you may want to get started on it here.
