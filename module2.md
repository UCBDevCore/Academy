# CSS

This week, we're really ramping up the amount of learning. We'll be using [FreeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org) again for CSS, please go through the rest of the Responsive Web Design Certification, skipping Accessibility and Responsive Web Design (but feel free to go through them if you have time).

Additional Resources (highly recommend):  
 - [MDN Docs: Box Model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Box_Model/Introduction_to_the_CSS_box_model)
 - [CSS Tricks: Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/)
 - [CSS Tricks: Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/)

Create a multipage site purely from HTML.

Feel free to be as creative as you want. Bonus points for meme value.
